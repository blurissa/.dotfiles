Marissa Johnson; To complete this lab, I created a VIM file, set it to the desired configurations by editing the file using i to insert text into the file, then I copied, moved, and renamed the file and saved it to my desktop. Afterwards, I wrote this short paragraph about my process. Some hurdles I faced were understanding how to use the commands, learning how to navigate the VIM interface, and how to use i to edit the file.
